# Algorithm
# You are in possession of the magical dice. You have to toss “1” three times in a row to receive US$ 100,000.

# However:

# Each failed toss will cost you US$ 1,000.
# Each failed toss followed by a successful toss will cost you US$ 7,800. e.g., 1 then {2,3,4,5,6}.
# However, you don’t have to pay if you stop playing.

# Each failed toss followed by 2 successful tosses will cost you US$ 49,500. e.g., 1,1 then {2,3,4,5,6}.
#However, you don’t have to pay if you stop playing.

# Questions:

# How many dice tosses do you need to get to 95% win confidence?
# Calculate your net gain/loss per toss.
# What is the minimum amount of prize money you will consider playing this game for? Calculate your relevant premium in this case.
# Please rationalise the most efficient strategy to maximise gain/minimise loss with 4 players playing this game simultaneously.
# Repeat question 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 under the following conditions:
# a. This time you have 2 dice.
# b. You have to toss “11”, “16”, or “66” three times in a row to receive US$ 3,000,000.
# c. However, there is an additional catch: upon the 3rd toss to reach 3 times in a row (right before winning), you can pay US$ 1,000,000 to destroy one die forever and win by tossing “1”. Will you pay, and why?
